#RRaven_Array
An object-oriented array, exposing common array manipulation functions in a sensible way.

Note that RRaven_Array uses boolean method names for clarity, eg: "and not" rather than "array_diff".

#RRaven_Stream_
A set of stream manipulation classes for use in processing large files with low memory overhead.

`RRaven_Stream_Transform_` classes implement `RRaven_Stream_Reader_Abstract` so a chain formed of multiple transforms can be constructed between a reader and a writer.

Note also that `RRaven_Stream_Reader_` classes implement Traversable, so can be looped over in a foreach loop as though they were a normal array.

#RRaven_Render_Exception
Renders an exception object in a human-readable colour-coded HTML format, pulling in code-snippets where possible.
